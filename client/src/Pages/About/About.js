          The MeatStick TRUE Wireless Smart Meat Thermometer and WiFi Bridge was
          created by Soma Labs LLC as they explored the intersection of
          technology and food. We took our knowledge of what it was like to cook
          for the first time, and figured out how to make it easier to make
          gourmet food.
